Remove client code (obviously)

Feedback for future delivery:

How much time to spend on the basics?  Chad thought I spent too much time on
basics and a lot of it was review. Steve felt like it had good ramp-up and was
helpful (partly because his background is more in Windows and he hasn't used
regexes for as long).

Chris suggests using one of the website tools that lets you visualize search
strings live.

Chad liked the live examples of refactoring - maybe I could flesh that out some
more?
